A project using Materialize, CSS and Javascript


Purpose: First of, I wanted to learn how Materialize works, and I would say I got the hang of it pretty easy.
But after trying to create something generic I got the idea for My AC Milan since I support the club and wanted to make it more interesting.
Therefore I decidded to create the custom javascript that lets me hide/show different divs upon clicking.

Since this is one of my first projects using javascript I'm happy with the result.

Time: This took a few hours, reading documentation is included in that time.

Issues: I stumbled upone a few issues, for example the card module in the materialize didn't work with flex, and I realized it was super easy to fix, it was just me being stick in the process of using flexbox.

Apart from that I found solutions to all other issues I came across fairly simple with the help of google search and stack overflow.
